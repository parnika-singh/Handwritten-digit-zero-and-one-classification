## About
In this project, we will use a Neural Network to recognise two hand written digits zero and one. This is a binary classification task.

## Applicaion
Automated handwritten digit classification is widely used today from recognising zip codes on mail envelopes to recognising amounts written on bank checks.

## Packages
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a popular library to plot graphs in Python.
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) a popular platform for machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a subset of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
